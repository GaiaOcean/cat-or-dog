# cat-or-dog

A deep learning model built with PyTorch for classifying images as either cats or dogs. This project uses ResNet18 with transfer learning, fine-tuned on a binary classification task. The model leverages pre-trained ImageNet weights for feature extraction and achieves high accuracy. Includes image preprocessing (resizing, cropping, and normalization) for optimal performance.

The dataset used was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification)
